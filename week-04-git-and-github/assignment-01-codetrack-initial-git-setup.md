# Assignment 1 — CodeTrack: Initial Git Setup (Local Only)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will set up Git correctly on your local machine before starting the CodeTrack project. You will create a local repository and configure your Git identity at both the repository level (local) and the machine level (global). This assignment is local only — you will not push anything to GitHub yet.

# Task 1 — Create the CodeTrack Project and Initialize Git

## Goal

Create a `CodeTrack` project folder and initialize it as a Git repository.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git init` inside `CodeTrack` showing "Initialized empty Git repository"

### Notes

**1. What is the `.git` folder, and why does it matter?**

.git is like the memory of your Git repository. It stores the history and information Git uses to manage your project.
The .git folder is a hidden directory created by Git inside a Git repository. It contains all the important information Git needs to track your project, including commits, branches, configuration, and version history.

# Task 2 — Configure Git Identity Locally (Repository-Only)

## Goal

Set your Git username and email for the `CodeTrack` repository only, using `git config --local`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config --local --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

<img width="486" height="389" alt="Screenshot 2026-10-02 123450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e09841-86dd-4cd7-9e9d-0be03bcf59ee" />


---

# Task 3 — Configure Git Identity Globally

## Goal

Set a global Git username and email for this machine using `git config --global`. Note that CodeTrack's local settings still take priority over these.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git config --global --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

<img width="551" height="206" alt="Screenshot 2026-10-02 123844" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1602abae-2499-4039-8a39-1bdf507dd5fd" />
